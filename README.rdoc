## Basic Info
Skavengr is a full-stack web application for creating and managing scavenger hunts.  Users, once they have signed up, can create a scavenger hunt. Our creation wizard allows users to drop different locations as pins on a map that dynamically updates with each location added, and add clues for players to find said spot.  Once on a quest, a users location will be constantly updated until they arrive at the quest location, at which point they will complete that objective.  Quest creators are able to track the progress of all users particapating in thier quests. Once all locations for a quest are completed, users are redirected to a page showing them who finished first and where they rank amongst finishers.
